# Advent of Code Kotlin Template

[Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ an annual event that happens in December since 2015.
Every year since then, with the first of December, a programming puzzles contest are published every day for twenty-four days.
A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide an input you have to use to provide an answer using the language of your choice.
Within this repository, we offer you a template prepared to use with [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

## Workflow
**Advent of Code Kotlin Template** is a special type of GitHub repository which lets you speed up the preparation phase and start writing your solutions immediately.
