# Advent of Code Kotlin Template

[Advent of Code][aoc] – an annual event in December since 2015.
Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
We offer you a template prepared to use with [Kotlin][kotlin] language within this repository.

## Workflow
**Advent of Code Kotlin Template** is a particular type of GitHub repository that lets you speed up the setup phase and start writing your AoC solutions immediately.

The general idea is straightforward – to create a new project based on this template, you need to log in to your GitHub account and use the **Use this template** green button.
And remember – **do not fork it!**

After creating a new project based on this template in your account, a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow will start and clean up the code from redundant files.
It will also personalize code to use your username and project name in namespaces and Gradle properties.
How cool is that?

Right after the @actions-user actor pushes the second commit to your repository, you're ready to clone it within the IntelliJ IDEA.
